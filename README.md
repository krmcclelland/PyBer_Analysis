# PyBer Analysis
At the request of Ms. Isualize, she would like us to perform some analysis on Ride-Sharing by Area to understand better how individuals use rideshare and the areas where the rides initiate.

# Overview
In analyzing the PyBer Summary, DataFrame shows a breakdown between area types (rural, suburban, and urban) of where the rides initiate. There is a greater demand for PyBer riders in urban areas than in suburban or rural cities. Below is summary information for January 2019 through May 2019, with the Urban area totaling 1,625 rides, next to the Suburban area with 625 lifts, and lastly, the Rural area with 125 rides.

There are also more drivers in the urban area due to the Urban size with 2,405 drivers, next to the Suburban area with 490 rides, and lastly, the Rural area with 78 lifts. Therefore, revenue is expected to be stronger in the urban area, but the Average Fare per Ride is lower than in other locations, and the Average Fare Per Driver is also lower. Therefore, since there is more driver competition in the Urban, there is a lower Average Fare per Ride and Fare per Driver.

"Total Fare by City Type" Supports the PyBer Summary DataFrame between January 2019 and April 2019. The yellow trend consistently shows fares in urban areas between $1,600 to $2,300 during the five months. In contrast, the orange trend shows fares between $750 to $1,400, and the blue trend shows Fares in rural areas between $250 to $500. The chart further demonstrates similar peak times in all these types of cities. The highest peak period was mid to late February 2019 across all areas, maybe from those celebrating Valentine's day. One unique peak in total fares among urban, suburban, and rural cities occurred sometime at the end of February 2019.

# Summerization of Information
* More ridesharing, drivers, and revenue are from the Urban Area.
* The Rider's costs in the Suburban and Rural areas pay more per ride than those in the Urbank Area.
* Additional analysis is recommended to review the times and distance ridesharing peaks, and maybe adding additional drivers in that area during that period would add additional revenue.
